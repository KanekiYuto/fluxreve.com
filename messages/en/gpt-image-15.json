    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is GPT Image 1.5 and how does it work?",
        "answer": "GPT Image 1.5 is an advanced AI image generator that creates images from text descriptions (Text-to-Image) or transforms existing images (Image-to-Image). It uses cutting-edge AI models to understand your prompts and generate images with controllable quality, resolution, and background settings. The dual-mode approach gives you flexibility to start from scratch or build upon reference images."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the quality levels and how do they differ?",
        "answer": "GPT Image 1.5 offers three quality tiers: Low (fast, 10 credits), Medium (balanced, 25-40 credits), and High (detailed, 95-140 credits). Low quality is perfect for rapid prototyping and concept testing. Medium quality provides a good balance of speed and detail for most projects. High quality delivers production-ready images with maximum detail, suitable for commercial work, marketing materials, and final deliverables."
      },
      {
        "question": "What resolution options are available?",
        "answer": "GPT Image 1.5 supports three resolution presets: 1024x1024 (square), 1536x1024 (landscape), and 1024x1536 (portrait). Square format works well for social media profiles and icons. Landscape is ideal for website banners and presentation slides. Portrait format suits mobile screens and story formats. Choose based on your intended use case."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Image-to-Image mode work?",
        "answer": "Image-to-Image mode lets you upload reference images (up to 5) and use text prompts to guide transformations. The AI analyzes your reference images and applies your prompt instructions while maintaining composition elements. This is perfect for style transfer, scene reimagining, product variations, and creative edits. You can transform photos into different art styles, change time periods, adjust lighting, or create variations of existing designs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the background options used for?",
        "answer": "GPT Image 1.5 offers three background modes: Auto (AI decides based on context), Transparent (creates PNG with alpha channel for overlays and compositing), and Opaque (solid background). Use Transparent for logos, icons, and elements you'll composite into other designs. Use Auto for natural scene generation. Use Opaque when you need a solid background color or scene."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does batch generation work?",
        "answer": "Batch generation allows you to create 1-4 images in a single generation request. This multiplies your credit cost by the number of images (e.g., Medium quality 1024x1024 costs 25 credits per image, so 4 images cost 100 credits total). Batch generation is perfect for exploring variations, testing different compositions, and rapid iteration without manual resubmission."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is seed control and when should I use it?",
        "answer": "Seed control lets you set a specific number that determines the AI's random generation behavior. Using the same seed with the same prompt and settings produces similar results, enabling reproducibility. This is essential for maintaining consistent visual style across brand materials, creating variations of approved concepts, and iterating on specific compositions. Leave blank for random seeds and creative variation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which output format should I choose?",
        "answer": "PNG offers lossless quality and transparency support (with Transparent background mode), ideal for logos, graphics, and compositing. JPEG provides smaller file sizes with slight compression, good for photos and web images where transparency isn't needed. WebP offers modern compression with quality similar to PNG but smaller files, perfect for web delivery if your platform supports it."
